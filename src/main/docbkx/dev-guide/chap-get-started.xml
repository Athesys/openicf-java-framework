 <title>Getting Started With the OpenICF Framework and OpenICF Connectors</title>
 <para>
  This chapter describes what is required before you begin to integrate an
  existing OpenICF connector into your Identity Management application.
 </para>

 <procedure>
  <para>
   Before you can use an OpenICF connector in your application, you must
   download the OpenICF framework bundles, and the required connector bundles,
   and add them to your CLASSPATH.
  </para>
  <para>
   The easiest way to start a new OpenICF project is to use the <link
   xlink:href="../resources/pom.xml" xlink:show="new">sample Maven project
   file</link> as a starting point. This sample project includes comprehensive
   comments about its use.
  </para>
  <para>
   Alternatively, follow these steps:
  </para>
  <step>
   <para>
    Download the OpenICF Connector Framework. If you are planning to use the
    PowerShell connector or the Active Directory connector, download the <link
    xlink:href="http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/webapp/browserepo.html?pathId=releases%3Aorg%2Fforgerock%2Fopenicf%2Fframework%2Fopenicf-zip%2F1.4.1.0%2Fopenicf-zip-1.4.1.0-dotnet.zip"
    xlink:show="new">.NET Framework</link>. For all other connectors, download
    the Java Framework from the <link
    xlink:href="http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/webapp/browserepo.html?15&amp;pathId=releases:org/forgerock/openicf/framework"
    xlink:show="new">ForgeRock Maven repository</link>.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Add the following JAR files to your CLASSPATH:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <filename>connector-framework.jar</filename> (compile and runtime
      dependency)
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <filename>connector-framework-internal.jar</filename> (runtime dependency
      only)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Download the specific connector bundle or bundles that you want to use, from
    the <link xlink:href="http://openicf.forgerock.org/connectors/index.html"
    xlink:show="new">OpenICF Connector Bundles</link> page.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Add the connector bundle or bundles to your CLASSPATH.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can now start integrating the connector with your application, as
    described in <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="dev-guide#chap-openicf-api"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Implementing the
    OpenICF API</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
  </step>
 </procedure>
 <note>
  <para>
   If you are building a new connector by using one of the OpenICF Maven
   connector archetypes, you do not need to download the Connector Framework
   separately. The required Connector Framework JAR files are downloaded
   automatically, because the Maven project defines the framework as a
   dependency.
  </para>
 </note>
 <para>
  After you have set up your project, you must implement the OpenICF API to call
  the connector implementations from your application.
 </para>
