 <title>Writing Scripted Connectors With the PowerShell Connector Toolkit</title>

 <para>
  You can use the PowerShell Connector Toolkit to create connectors that can
  provision any Microsoft system, including, but not limited to, Active
  Directory, MS SQL, MS Exchange, Sharepoint, Office365, and Azure. Essentially,
  any task that can be performed with PowerShell can be executed through
  connectors based on this toolkit.
 </para>
 <para>
  The PowerShell Connector Toolkit is not a complete connector, in the
  traditional sense. Rather, it is a framework within which you must write your
  own PowerShell scripts to address the requirements of your Microsoft Windows
  ecosystem.
 </para>
 <para>
  Connectors created with the PowerShell Connector Toolkit run on the
  .NET platform and require the installation of a .NET connector server on the
  Windows system. To install the .NET connector server, follow the instructions
  in <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="dev-guide#install-dotnet-connector-server"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">Installing a .NET Connector
  Server</link>. These connectors also require PowerShell V2.
 </para>
 <para>
  The PowerShell Connector Toolkit is available, with a subscription, from
  ForgeRock Backstage. To install the connector, download the archive
  (<filename>mspowershell-connector-1.4.1.0.zip</filename>) and extract the
  <filename>MsPowerShell.Connector.dll</filename> to the same folder in which
  the Connector Server (<filename>connectorserver.exe</filename>) is located.
  OpenIDM Enterprise includes sample connectors for Active Directory, and
  scripts that will enable you to get started with this toolkit.

  <title>About the PowerShell Scripting Language</title>
  <para>
   PowerShell combines a command-line shell and scripting language, built on the
   .NET Framework. For a comprehensive introduction to PowerShell, and examples
   of how to use it, see Microsoft's TechNet article, <link xlink:show="new"
